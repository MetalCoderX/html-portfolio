<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar Way of Water</h3>
<p>
  James Cameron has done it again by creating yet another <b>epic.</b> The
  fantasy that was shown by Cameron is out of this world. I mean he took more
  than 2 deades to write it and when he came up with it it was like as if he had
  never been away!
</p>
<h3>Antman Quantumania</h3>
<p>
  The Avengers are back but with the <b>'smallest'</b> character of the
  franchise. What a way to go!
</p>
<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>
  A very tragic story of how fragile human lives is in the context of the
  brutality of war.
