<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Harun and am starting to pick up a new skill. I've always wanted to
  learn how to code and this is my attempt at it. I believe that in the current era of thing being done on online, having a website is indeed useful.
  </p>

<p>
  So join me in this journey of mine as I learn and pick up a new skill. 
  So see you around. I'll be glad to have you in my journey.  
</p>

<p>
  A journey of 10000 miles start with a single step. And the step is now.
